Flowy makes creating WebApps with flowchart functionality an incredibly simple task. Build automation software, mind mapping tools, or simple programming platforms in minutes by implementing the library into your project.

## Installation
Adding Flowy to your WebApp is incredibly simple:

1.  Link  `flowy.min.js`  and  `flowy.min.css`  to your project. Through jsDelivr: 
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/alyssaxuu/flowy/flowy.min.css"> 
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/alyssaxuu/flowy/flowy.min.js"></script>
```
2.  Create a canvas element that will contain the flowchart (for example,  `<div id="canvas"></div>`)
3.  Create the draggable blocks with the  `.create-flowy`  class (for example,  `<div class="create-flowy">Grab me</div>`)

## Running Flowy

### Initialization
```javascript
flowy(canvas, ongrab, onrelease, onsnap, onrearrange, spacing_x, spacing_y);
```

Parameter | Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
   `canvas` | *javascript DOM element* | The element that will contain the blocks 
   `ongrab` | *function* (optional) |  Function that gets triggered when a block is dragged
   `onrelease` | *function* (optional) |  Function that gets triggered when a block is released
   `onsnap` | *function* (optional) |  Function that gets triggered when a block snaps with another one
   `onrearrange` | *function* (optional) |  Function that gets triggered when blocks are rearranged
   `spacing_x` | *integer* (optional) |  Horizontal spacing between blocks (default 20px)
   `spacing_y` | *integer* (optional) |  Vertical spacing between blocks (default 80px)

To define the blocks that can be dragged, you need to add the class `.create-flowy`

### Example
**HTML**
```html
<div class="create-flowy">The block to be dragged</div>
<div id="canvas"></div>
```
**Javascript**
```javascript
var spacing_x = 40;
var spacing_y = 100;
// Initialize Flowy
flowy(document.getElementById("canvas"), onGrab, onRelease, onSnap, onRearrange, spacing_x, spacing_y);
function onGrab(block){
	// When the user grabs a block
}
function onRelease(){
	// When the user releases a block
}
function onSnap(block, first, parent){
	// When a block can attach to a parent
	return true;
}
function onRearrange(block, parent){
	// When a block is rearranged
}
```
## Callbacks
In order to use callbacks, you need to add the functions when initializing Flowy, as explained before.
### On grab
```javascript
function onGrab(block){
	// When the user grabs a block
}
```
Gets triggered when a user grabs a block with the class `create-flowy`

Parameter | Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
   `block` | *javascript DOM element* | The block that has been grabbed
   
### On release
```javascript
function onRelease(){
	// When the user lets go of a block
}
```
Gets triggered when a user lets go of a block, regardless of whether it attaches or even gets released in the canvas.

### On snap
```javascript
function onSnap(block, first, parent){
	// When a block can attach to a parent
	return true;
}
```
Gets triggered when a block can attach to another parent block. You can either prevent the attachment, or allow it by using `return true;`

Parameter | Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
   `block` | *javascript DOM element* | The block that has been grabbed
   `first` | *boolean* | If true, the block that has been dragged is the first one in the canvas
   `parent` | *javascript DOM element* | The parent the block can attach to
   
### On rearrange
```javascript
function onRearrange(block, parent){
	// When a block is rearranged
	return true;
}
```
Gets triggered when blocks are rearranged and are dropped anywhere in the canvas, without a parent to attach to. You can either allow the blocks to be deleted, or prevent it and thus have them re-attach to their previous parent using `return true;`

Parameter | Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
   `block` | *javascript DOM element* | The block that has been grabbed
   `parent` | *javascript DOM element* | The parent the block can attach to
   
## Methods
### Get the flowchart data
```javascript
// As an object
flowy.output();
// As a JSON string
JSON.stringify(flowy.output());
```
The JSON object that gets outputted looks like this:
```json
{
	"html": "",
	"blockarr": [],
	"blocks": [
		{
			"id": 1,
			"parent": 0,
			"data": [
				{
				"name": "blockid",
				"value": "1"
				}
			],
			"attr": [
				{
				"id": "block-id",
				"class": "block-class"
				}
			]
		}
	]
}
```

Here's what each property means:

Key | Value type | Description
--- | --- | ---
   `html` | *string* | Contains the canvas data
   `blockarr` | *array* | Contains the block array generated by the library (for import purposes)  
   `blocks` | *array* | Contains the readable block array
   `id` | *integer* | Unique value that identifies a block 
   `parent` | *integer* |  The `id` of the parent a block is attached to (-1 means the block has no parent)
   `data` | *array of objects* |  An array of all the inputs within a certain block
   `name` | *string* |  The name attribute of the input
   `value` | *string* |  The value attribute of the input
   `attr` | *array of objects* |  Contains all the data attributes of a certain block
### Import the flowchart data
```javascript
flowy.import(output)
```
Allows you to import entire flowcharts initially exported using the previous method, `flowy.output()`

Parameter | Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
   `output` | *javascript DOM element* | The data from `flowy.output()`
   
#### Warning

This method accepts raw HTML and does **not** sanitize it, therefore this method is vulnerable to [XSS](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/DOM_Based_XSS). The _only_ safe use for this method is when the input is **absolutely** trusted, if the input is _not_ to be trusted the use this method can introduce a vulnerability in your system.

### Delete all blocks
To remove all blocks at once use:
```javascript
flowy.deleteBlocks()
```
Currently there is no method to individually remove blocks. The only way to go about it is by splitting branches manually.
